# Fraud-detection-ML

Problem Statement: In the banking industry, detecting credit card fraud using machine learning is not just a trend; it is a necessity for banks, as they need to put proactive monitoring and fraud prevention mechanisms in place. Machine learning helps these institutions reduce time-consuming manual reviews, costly chargebacks and fees, and denial of legitimate transactions. Suppose we are part of the analytics team working on a fraud detection model and its cost-benefit analysis. We need to develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent transactions based on the historical transactional data of customers with a pool of merchants. Based on your understanding of the model, you have to analyse the business impact of these fraudulent transactions
and recommend the optimal ways that the bank can adopt to mitigate the fraud risks. 

Description : In this capstone project, you need to build a fraud detection model to help banks identify credit card frauds and be vigilant enough to reduce losses incurred due to such unauthorised transactions by the fraudsters.

Techniques/Algorithms Used:

Splitting data into Train / Test: Once required columns are identified and felt important
are selected in X and target variable is_fraud is on y at the ratio of 70 : 30 ratio.

Algorithms:
1) Logestic Regression
2) Decision Tree Classifier
3) Random Forest
4) XG Boost

Balancing Techniques:
1) Random OverSampling
2) Random UnderSampling
3) SMOTE
